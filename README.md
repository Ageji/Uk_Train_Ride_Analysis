### Project Overview
This project focused on analyzing train ride data to identify patterns and trends in the UK transportation system. Key areas of analysis included the most popular routes, peak travel times, revenue distribution by ticket types and classes, and the assessment of on-time performance. By examining these factors, I was able to provide valuable insights into operational efficiency, customer behavior, and potential areas for improvement in service delivery.

### Data Source
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Maven Analytics, which provides comprehensive datasets on various aspects of the UK train ride system.

### Tools
- postgre sql - Data Analysis
- Power Bi - Creating Report

   ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  EDA involves exploring the Uk_Train_rides dataset to answer this questions:

- What are the most popular routes?
- What are the peak travel times?
- How does revenue vary by ticket types and classes?
- What is the on-time performance? What are the main contributing factors?

  ### Findings
- The analysis identified the most frequently traveled routes, with the highest demand observed between major cities, such as Manchester Piccadilly to Liverpool Lime Street and London Euston to Birmingham New Street. These routes are essential for optimizing train schedules and capacity planning.
- The peak travel times were between 6-8 AM and 6-8 PM, with a noticeable surge in demand during these hours. This highlights the need for additional services during these time frames to accommodate commuters.
- Revenue generation was highest from Advance tickets in Standard Class, followed by Off-Peak and Anytime tickets. First Class tickets, while less frequent, contributed significantly to overall revenue due to higher ticket prices.
- The on-time performance rate was 86.88%, with delays mainly caused by weather, technical issues, and signal failures. Other contributing factors included staff shortages and traffic.

  ### Recommedation
- Given the high demand on routes such as Manchester Piccadilly to Liverpool Lime Street and London Euston to Birmingham New Street, it is recommended to evaluate the possibility of increasing the frequency of services on these routes, particularly during peak travel periods. This would ensure that capacity aligns with passenger demand, improving service reliability and reducing overcrowding.
 - The analysis identified that there is a high number of commuters traveling during the periods of 6-8 AM and 6-8 PM. During these times, trains are likely more crowded, which can lead to a less comfortable experience for passengers. To address this, the suggestion is to modify the train schedules by either adding more train services during these peak periods or adjusting the times of existing services. This would help ensure there are enough trains to accommodate the high demand, reduce overcrowding, and improve the overall passenger experience.
- To address delays and improve on-time performance, it is recommended to focus on mitigating key contributing factors such as weather, technical issues, signal failures, staff shortages, and traffic. With an on-time performance rate of 86.88%, investing in better maintenance and real-time monitoring systems can help reduce technical issues and signal failures. Additionally, developing advanced weather forecasting and contingency plans will help manage weather-related delays more effectively. Furthermore, addressing staffing shortages by optimizing resource allocation, cross-training staff, and implementing backup measures during peak times will minimize delays and improve operational efficiency.
